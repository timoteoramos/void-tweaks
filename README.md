Void Tweaks
===========

This is my personal setup for Void Linux. You just need to run these scripts on a clean Void Linux installation, without any DE. I use the musl release, but it should work with glibc release too.

Run `sudo bash setup.sh` to install everything or browse the `scripts` folder to run specific scripts.
